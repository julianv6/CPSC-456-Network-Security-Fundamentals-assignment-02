PART 1 QUESTIONS
1.    The copy command in windows copies files from source to destination. When using /b, files are copied in binary format thus the bits of two files are merged together to create a single file. In windows, files are opened based on its extension. Each of the extension is given a program to open the file.


2.    This shows that the file is able to open w/o any issues. The file also contains additional binary data that is part of the zip file. This can be carefully programmed to inject code into executing instructions and take over the buffer and perform other malicious actions by using its return pointer to continue executing other malicious code.

3.    This will be detected by anti-virus programs because it scans for malware using signatures. Thus the additional bits of data will be detected and the file could be deleted. There are however many ways to avoid detection of such code by encoding its payload, which will make it harder to detect.
